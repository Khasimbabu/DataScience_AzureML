Train a machine learning model with Azure Machine Learning 
===========================================================
*************************************************************\

Training a machine learning model can be as easy as loading data and running one line of code using packages like scikit-learn. However, in a production machine learning scenario, you need to consider:

Creating reusable training scripts for multiple compute environments.

Logging model performance metrics during training and evaluation processes.

Tracking model versions.

Use a ScriptRunConfig to run a model training script as an Azure Machine Learning experiment.

Run a training script
*************************
You can use a ScriptRunConfig to run a script-based experiment that trains a machine learning model.

When using an experiment to train a model, your script should save the trained model in the outputs folder. For example, the following script trains a model using Scikit-Learn, and saves it in the outputs folder using the joblib package:


Working with script arguments
***************************************
To use parameters in a script, you must use a library such as argparse to read the arguments passed to the script and assign them to variables. For example, the following script reads an argument named --reg-rate, which is used to set the regularization rate hyperparameter for the logistic regression algorithm used to train a model.
